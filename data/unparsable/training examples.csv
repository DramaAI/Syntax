1,"In the wake of the French Revolution, France underwent a dramatic change. The once-powerful monarchy had been dismantled, giving way to a burgeoning republic that promised liberty, equality, and fraternity. Intellectuals thrived in this new era, engaging in fervent discourse to shape the nascent government. Paris, the heart of the nation, became a hub of cultural change, where artists and philosophers alike sought to capture the spirit of the times. The countryside, too, experienced change as feudal bonds were dismantled and peasants gained more autonomy. Despite the turmoil and the Reign of Terror that followed, the post-revolutionary period laid the stage for modern French society, laying the groundwork for a secular state and a new social order.","In the wake of the French Revolution, France underwent a dramatic transformation.

2,"After the law passed, anti-slavery people were worried that the Kansas Territory would become a slave state. This is because the state next to Kansas is Missouri, which was a slave state. People believed that the first settlers in Kansas would be from Missouri. To stop Missouri from influencing Kansas, anti-slavery people from around the United States moved to Kansas. These people wanted to make Kansas a free state. These people were called ""free-staters."" The New England Emigrant Aid Company (NEEAC) helped anti-slavery people move to Kansas. It sent two men named Charles L. Robinson and Charles H. Branscomb to explore the place. They would decide a good place to send people. They saw Hogback Ridge, and they liked it because it was close to the Oregon Trail. They told the NEEAC to move people to this place.","After the law passed, anti-slavery people were worried that the Kansas Territory would become a slave state.

3,"Before the sufferings of others I am always utterly powerless, and the letter you gave me reveals such depths of suffering that I hardly know what to say to you. This indeed is not my last word—but it must be my first. You are not isolated, verily, in such states of feeling as this—that is, in the sense that you appear to make all the misery of all mankind your own; only I have a terrible feeling that you give all and receive nothing—that there is no reciprocity in your sympathy—that you have all the affliction of it and none of the returns. However—I am determined not to speak to you except with the voice of stoicism. I don’t know why we live—the gift of life comes to us from I don’t know what source or for what reason; but I believe we can go on living for the reason that (always of course up to a certain point) life is the most valuable thing we know anything about and it is therefore presumptively a great mistake to surrender it while there is any yet left in the cup.

4,"The inspiration these pro-athlete moms provide isn’t simply in athletics; it’s also in well-being broadly defined. Studies show that maintaining balance across multiple life domains contributes to psychological health and reduces risk for depression and anxiety. A diversity of passions can reduce burnout and improve psychological health in both athletes and non-athletes. And it can propel excellence (despite less time and physical resources) by propelling a deeper sense of purpose. Huck, for instance, shared that she had long grappled with the “why” of pushing so hard in her sport. Before parenthood, it had been about seeing what she was capable of. But that purpose never felt particularly profound. Since becoming a mom, though, the meaning has changed. Tearing up, she explained that she wants to make her baby proud, to hear him say, “My mom was an Olympian.’”","The inspiration these pro-athlete moms provide isn’t simply in athletics; it’s also in well-being broadly defined.

5,"WeWork’s rapid rise transformed it into one of the world’s most feted startups, valued at $47bn in 2019. Its fall has been faster. Just four years after getting that peak valuation, the business has filed for bankruptcy. Dressed in the cloak of a technology company, WeWork turned out to be an office rental business – one that was undone by problems of its own making and finally by forces beyond its control. During WeWork’s ascent, it spent heavily to get a mass of long-term leases in some of the world’s most expensive real estate markets. These commercial properties were then subdivided into smaller spaces for tenants, usually on a short-term basis. But its pitch to customers was more than cheap desks and tech. It sought to present itself at the heart of myriad utopian ideals, in pursuit of a “mission” to “elevate the world’s consciousness”.","WeWork’s rapid rise transformed it into one of the world’s most feted startups, valued at $47bn in 2019.
